This function has two parts: UI and Generation

UI:
-Use canvas.data to store values
-Generate key by drawing white rectangles and then black on top if that white key has a sharp
-Take the user's mouse press and find out what key/rhythm pressed
-Undo removes the last element added
-Restart runs init()
-Help screen describes it all, does not affect input
-sleeps after all of measure input, then automatically destroys the window
-Wanted a simple screen so that users know that this program is a tool more than a cool product

Generation:
-Takes the list, and uses music21's modules to represent it as musicXML data:
	-pitch.Pitch()
	-note.Note()
	-measure.Measure()
	-stream()
	-analysis.discrete.KrumhanslKessler() (algorithm to get keyWeight)
-Uses recursive backtracking to find the next possible note in a sequence.
Once there is not possible result for that function call, it backtracks to the last successful call and tries again on a different note until we get to the end.
-To determine a good note, we check for:
	-pitch is in correct key
	-pitch follows last pitch in a valid interval jump
	-pitch is in a valid cadence progression
-Uses .show() to display the piece in an musicXML editor (i.e. MuseScore 1.3)
